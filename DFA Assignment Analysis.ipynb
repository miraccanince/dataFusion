    "We want to predict the position of a pedestrian using a floorplan and refraining from using GPS. We can use a IMU which produces acceleration, and orientation data. (It also produces temperature, compass \n",
    ", pressure and humidity data but those are probably not relevant to the problem we are trying to solve.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We should use a non-trivial floorplan in buildings or carparkingdeck while we avoid entering the actual parking spaces. We will need to measure this floorplan or obtain the drawings of the building.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper assumes there is a detector that tells you that a stride took place and at the same time gives you the change in orientation of the IMU (in this case the orientation of the RPi as the IMU is an integral part of it.) This sensor information is used in a Bayesian inference\n",
    " step to estimate the location.\n",
    " \n",
    " So in high level pseudo code, we want to achieve the following:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```{r, eval=FALSE,tidy=FALSE}\n",
    " repeat:\n",
    "     timestamp = wait_for_stride_event  # initially button press, later infered from accelerometer\n",
    "     orientation = read gyroscope\n",
    "     loc = infer_most_likely_location(loc, orientation)  # using a variant of eq. 5\n",
    "     publish_or_store_location(loc, timestamp)\n",
    "```     \n",
    "\n",
    "From this code we can see that we need to specify an initial condition, because `infer_most_likely_location` takes the previous location as an input argument. Also it is at present not entirely clear whether location is a single point or a probability distribution. Koroglu and Yilmaz write about using a mode seeking algorithm, the paper is a bit vague about whether this is used only for producing a single definite answer at each time step or also used as only input to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other problem we can see with this pseudocode is that the orientation coming from the SenseHat is relative to its initial orientation, not relative to the map. So again we need to initialize make an assumption about the initial orienation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The assumptions we make here influence how we can use our code later. If we assume an initial location and orientation we need to boot the RPi at this location and orientation during testing! We wil make this simplifying assumption anyway, and our pseudocode becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r, eval=FALSE,tidy=FALSE}\n",
    " '''\n",
    " When using this code you need to start at the initial location and the length RPi should be aligned with the arrow on the floorplan. When moving in direction of the arrow on the floorplan it corresponds with varying the second index in our array representing it.\n",
    " '''\n",
    "\n",
    " loc = initial_location  \n",
    " \n",
